# Dum-E Commerce
Fake e-commerce application built with ReactJs 
## Current State - I just started
- React is entirely new to me, and this might take a while, but seems like a fun old time
- I'm also now settling into a format for my ReadMe's: Title, abstract, current state, technologies used, what's next
## What's inside?
- ReactJs
## Next up
- Uhhhh, look different from a default React App
- Reusable Components! (That can be used across projects, even)
- Maybe SASS for better CSS
- Cute animations (Framer motion?)
